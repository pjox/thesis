            In which we present a part of the work of \citet{popa-fabre-etal-2020-french} who construct a balanced corpus for contemporary French that could be used for language modeling; and of \citet{ortiz-suarez-etal-2020-establishing} who aligned both the Universal Dependencies and the TEI-annotated NER version of the French Treebank, correcting multiple annotation mistakes and discrepancies, and who then converted the NER annotations to a more machine-ready CoNLL-like format that is more often used for training neural models.
